## Hi +_+ðŸ‘‹

I am Lilian Brinzan, a Full Stack Developer. I want to grow my personal brand [Shop](https://cotton-world.online/) and build a team. I have a degree in business administration and worked as an economics lecturer in Moldova. For ten years, I was part of the analytical department at CNA, where I developed IT skills.  

After moving to Germany, I learned the language and started my career here. I worked at REWE-Markt GmbH and from January to September 2023, I completed a Java programming course at AIT-TR GmbH in Berlin. I speak Romanian fluently, have a B2 level in German, and basic English skills.  

I have experience with Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL.
